# bonfire-frontend

This app serves as the frontend for [bonfire](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/bonfire). The goal is to provide an accessible platform to reserve and utilize namespaces in the ephemeral cluster.

This is a WIP, and is built from the RedHatInsights [starter-app](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-starter-app).

## Getting started

1. ```npm install```

2. ```PROXY=true npm run start:beta```

3. Open browser in URL listed in the terminal output

Update `config/dev.webpack.config.js` according to your application URL. [Read more](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components/tree/master/packages/config#useproxy).

### Testing

`npm run verify` will run `npm run lint` (eslint) and `npm test` (Jest)

## Deploying

- The starter repo uses Travis to deploy the webpack build to another Github repo defined in `.travis.yml`
  - That Github repo has the following branches:
    - `ci-beta` (deployed by pushing to `master` or `main` on this repo)
    - `ci-stable` (deployed by pushing to `ci-stable` on this repo)
    - `qa-beta` (deployed by pushing to `qa-beta` on this repo)
    - `qa-stable` (deployed by pushing to `qa-stable` on this repo)
    - `prod-beta` (deployed by pushing to `prod-beta` on this repo)
    - `prod-stable` (deployed by pushing to `prod-stable` on this repo)
- Travis uploads results to RedHatInsight's [codecov](https://codecov.io) account. To change the account, modify CODECOV_TOKEN on https://travis-ci.com/.
